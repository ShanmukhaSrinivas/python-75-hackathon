PVM:A python program contains source code that is first compiled by python compiler to produce byte code.This byte code is given to 
python virtual machine(PVM) which converts the byte code to machine code. This macine code is run by the processor and finally the 
results are produced.

pyhon virtual machine is a software that contains an interpreter that converts the byte code to machine code.PVM is most often called as 
python interpreter.The PVM of pypy contains a compiler in addition to the interpreter.This compiler is called Just In time(JIT)compiler 
which is useful to speed up execution of the python program.
